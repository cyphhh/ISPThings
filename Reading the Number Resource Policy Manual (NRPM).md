- You bypass the waitlist described in section 4.1.8, which is for existing ISPs needing additional space.
**Requirements**

- After signing the RSA and paying fees, ARIN issues the /24 within 2 business days.
**Utilization Rates**
- Show 50% of the allocated /24 is assigned within 24 months. This allows flexibility to build the customer base.
**Key Takeaways** 
- New ISPs get an initial /24 automatically under current ARIN policy. No waitlist.
